## Basic Tools

I highly recommend [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education.](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) It goes in depth about how to use the shell, scripting, built-in code editors like VIM (a bit too dogmatic for me but helpful for quick fixes in the CL). If this feels a bit too much, leave it for some other time or skip around.

### Choose an IDE

What is an [IDE?](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide)

[VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

There are dozens of IDEs and it really comes down to personal preferences. To keep things simple, choose one and try to stick to it. You can try others once you get a grasp of the more important topics. 

### Virtual Environment

[MiniConda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) - An absolute must for handling complicated image processing and deep learning dependencies.

### Git
What is [Git?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

How [we use Git?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

### Github
Create a github [account](https://github.com/) if you haven't already.

## Image processing
Familiarize yourself with the basics of image processing in Python.

- [OpenCV Tutorial](https://opencv24-python-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html)
- [SciKit-Image](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/)
- [Scipy](https://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/image_processing/)

## Object Oriented Programming

- RealPython.com [tutorial](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

## Configuration
We run all the pipelines by using [Hydra.](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/)

## Resources
Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, 2nd ed. [Richard Szeliski, 2022](https://szeliski.org/Book/)
